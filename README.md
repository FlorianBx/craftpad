## How to use

Type `/craftpad` or `/cp` in game to open the window.

Search for an item and click on it. The right side shows:
- The full recipe
- Your current materials (from bags and banks)
- What you still need
- **Community crafters** who can make the item (with their profession level)

Material counts update automatically while you play.

### Community Crafters Feature

The addon automatically shares your professions with other players in your communities who also have Craftpad installed. This happens:
- When you log in (5 seconds delay)
- When you learn or level up a profession

When you select an item, you'll see a list of players from your communities who can craft it, along with their skill level. No manual scanning needed - it's all automatic!

**Privacy**: Your profession data is only shared within WoW communities you're already a member of, and only with players who have Craftpad installed.

## Installation

1. Download the addon
2. Extract to `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/`
3. Restart WoW or type `/reload` in game
